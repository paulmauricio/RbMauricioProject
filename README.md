Title of Webpage: Habanero Heroes

Description: The site is meant to introduce the characters from a storyline me and a few friends have created. We hope to share our comical ideas for our fictional universe. The idea behind the site is to gain an audience.

Website Outline - 
Homepage: The idea for the homepage was to put most of the focus on the characters. I wanted to show them off in a more visual way. I put more time into the creative elements such as navigation. I want my webpage to look interesting and stand out.
Subpages: The subpages main focus is on the introduction of characters. The navigation is toned down and is reduced to a 'return to homepage' button so that the user can return to the main navigation and see the other pages.
